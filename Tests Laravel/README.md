Findings:
I can already tell from comparing both documents Laravel has a LOT more info to make it easier to install. As I thought, Laravel is quite simple as it's basically just installing composer and executing some lines in the command window. 

Laravel appears to be a lot more heavy though, it takes more resources to run and is a tad bit slower.
