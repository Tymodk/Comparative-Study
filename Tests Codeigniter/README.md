Findings: 
It's not incredibly hard to set CodeIgniter up, but it's done all manually, I feel like they could've updated this to be a bit more streamlined. I've also read on several blogs that CodeIgniter is a bit behind on some principles that Laravel has picked up, for example. 

However, CodeIgniter's got a big positive thing going for it, it's a lot more light-weight. It takes significantly lesser resources than Laravel, allowing it to run far better.
