# Comparative Study Codeigniter vs Laravel
I first wanted to get in the real technological side of this comparative study, and started looking up benchmarks for both Codeigniter and Laravel, on different php versions too. 
The next step was to gather more information about the two.

I've found the following links that pertain to both, so I'll be recording them in my logbook rather than the tests. 
<a href="https://www.codeclouds.com/blog/laravel-vs-codeigniter-a-difficult-choice/">A nice and simple comparison between the two!</a>
<a href="https://www.slant.co/versus/3756/9622/~codeigniter_vs_laravel-5">Another comparison between the two.</a>

I'll probably draw from a few comparison blogs to draw my own conclusions about these two frameworks. At this moment it seems that people seem to enjoy Laravel a lot more, I'll find out why!

In the meantime I've also looked up how to set both up, I already know how to use Laravel but with Codeigniter there was a lot less documentation. 

Found a bit more comparison data about Laravel and CodeIgniter, and some other frameworks but I'll be focusing on those two ofcourse!

Found some popularity survey results about Laravel & CodeIgniter as well:
