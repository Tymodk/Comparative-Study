# Comparative Study Codeigniter vs Laravel
I first wanted to get in the real technological side of this comparative study, and started looking up benchmarks for both Codeigniter and Laravel, on different php versions too. 
The next step was to gather more information about the two.

I've found the following links that pertain to both, so I'll be recording them in my logbook rather than the tests.
